# FamEmu

![Alt text](/screenshots/Demo.png?raw=true "Demonstration")

FamEmu is an app written in Rust to emulate Famicom. Current stage: emulating simple snake game.

Currently dropped due to lack of time.

### Note: to compile SDL2 on Windows, do this:
1. Download from https://www.libsdl.org/ SDL2-devel for msvc
2. Unpack all lib files (in my case for x64) to C:\Users\USERNAME\\.rustup\toolchains\stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\lib\rustlib\x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\lib
3. Run cargo
